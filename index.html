            Down the Rabbit-Hole
        </h2>
        <p>
            <span class="text-bold">Alice</span> was beginning to get <span class="text-bold">very</span>  tired of sitting by her sister on
            the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped
            into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
            conversations in it,
            <span class="background-color">“and what is the use of a book,”</span> thought Alice “without
            pictures or conversations?”
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            So she was considering in her own mind
            <span class="text-decoration">
                (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very
                sleepy and stupid)</span
            >, whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the
            trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White
            Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was nothing so <span class="font-style">very</span> remarkable in that; nor did Alice
            think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
            itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!”
            <span class="text-d">
                (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that
                she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all
                seemed quite natural);</span>
            but when the Rabbit actually
            <span class="font-style">took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</span>, and looked at it,
            and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed
            across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either
            a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with
            curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was
            just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
